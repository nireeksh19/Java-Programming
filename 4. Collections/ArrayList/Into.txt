The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.

The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want. The syntax is also slightly different.

The ArrayList class has many useful methods. For example, to add elements to the ArrayList, use the add() method.

To access an element in the ArrayList, use the get() method and refer to the index number.

To modify an element, use the set() method and refer to the index number.

To remove an element, use the remove() method and refer to the index number.

To remove all the elements in the ArrayList, use the clear() method.

To find out how many elements an ArrayList have, use the size method.

Another useful class in the java.util package is the Collections class, which include the sort() method for sorting lists alphabetically or numerically.
